# PixiJS Langton's Ant

A two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. 
Invented by Chris Langton in 1986. The original implementation uses only black and white cells, 
the implementation below uses N colors based on the ammount of movements. [Inspired by this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-gtr4pEBU).
